|common questions   | trailbee  | skyscanner |  uni group project |  
|---|---|---|---|
|challenges   | pace of development | learning internal tools and system design | getting feedback that wasn't in the form of tests |  
|mistakes/failures  | didn't give enough attention to testing. should've went for an event driven design | put off asking for help for too long which blocked projects | encouraging other teams to work with us to help better us both |  
|enjoyed   | the amount of knowledge gained | being able to talk to experienced developers in all areas very easily | Getting other students excited about technologies that I had only recently learned |  
|leadership| basically single man team  | NA  | Made myself as available as possible, provided a foundation for them to expand on if they were unsure of things such as agile, or spring. |  
|conflicts| often had to cut down what was being asked to a more realistic level  | observed conflict between other developers, one not being taken seriously despite having valid opinions that went against the majority | one student was not putting in effort, and blamed it on being stuck with a bug. While frustrating, I found that just being around while he was working and being available to help get him past the issue was enough to increase his involvement |  
|what you'd do differently| focus on an MVP rather than trying to do everything at once | be quicker to ask for help, rather than finding myself deep down rabbit holes due to a misunderstanding of the problem | get the team together more often to work together rather than just discuss progress so that we could each better understand the problems the others were having. |  

> What are your weaknesses

I've found that I often spend too long trying to solve a problem myself when asking for help can save so much time. A lot of what I've learned and what has made me a fairly good developer has come from trying out different solutions, finding they don't work, and then trying another. But sometimes people with experience can provide that same learning in a fraction of the time, and is something I discussed with my manager and worked on more towards the end of the internship.
