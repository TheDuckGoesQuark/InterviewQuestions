| role description                    | Started as a backend engineer in a team of 12 engineers. Grew into a full stack role when our web engineer left. Responsible for the growing the web engineering team, and the collaboration features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
| challenges                          | Growing pains of a startup: a lot of information was siloed due to parts of the product only ever being worked on by one engineer. This also meant that context around design decisions wasn't always clear, and led to a lot of duplication and spaghetti logic. As part of leading the collaboration team, I would hold daily stand ups to encourage context sharing around current work, which often produced knowledge sharing conversations. While growing the web team I also organised the web guild, where the web engineers would regularly discuss a growing web practices document so we could agree on things like how to structure our components and propose changes or new technologies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
| mistakes/failures                   | I joined Gravity Sketch fairly fresh out of university, and I still very much had an "intern" mindset. I was excited to take technical ownership and accountability of the product, but I wasn't proactive or pushing for changes that I saw as potentially valuable based on user feedback and my own usage of the product. I would still mention these ideas, but wouldn't actively push for them to be discussed as part of the roadmap, putting faith in the "leadership team" to have the same context. I remained a "task-taker" for some time, and didn't realise the growth that I was missing out on until a discussion with our engineering manager. After this discussion however, I began pushing more to address the issues I was seeing. Alongside my normal work, I began building POCs for solutions that I wanted the team to consider, and documenting and organising discussions of how we can move forward with problems that would change things at a larger scale. This change in mindset allowed me to have a much bigger impact, but my lack of introspection delayed the change. | 
| enjoyed                             | My favourite aspect of my time at Gravity Sketch was the intensive learning that would occur across a wide range of domains. An of example would be when we wanted to support SSO for our enterprise users, I had to learn how Identity Providers work, the various protocols in use for authenticating users, and what the most flexible approach would be so that we could make SSO integration self serve for our users. Supporting SSO from VR headsets took some creativity. <br/> Another project that required deep diving to solve user issues was solving the instability of our user file manager. We found that performance would decrease sharply as the number of files increased, and that when CPU time was limited (due to sharing with design software for example), operations would cause flickering and often unexpected results. Addressing these issues meant diving deeper into how react, javascript, and the browser DOM works. This allowed me to identify sources of extra renders, god components with far too much shared state, and an unstable caching mechanism with SWR. | 
| leadership                          | After a year and a half at GS, our only dedicated web engineer left for another role. In order for our product to continue improving to meet our users needs, I took on their responsibilities. So that I could learn from other web engineers and grow our team, I designed and carried out interviews, using a debugging and implementation exercise based on issues we had faced within our own codebase. I was responsible for enforcing good practices within the growing team, providing product context and growth opportunities to the new joiners, and was accountable for the success of features we worked on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 
| conflicts                           | Growing pains within a startup are to be expected. In GS, a lot of conflicts came from failures in communication leading to dead-end projects, or the delaying of necessary conversations until certain key stakeholders were available. After two projects were discarded shortly after kick-off, I observed that team morale had taken a severe hit, and that exciting momentum that motivates engineers had been fully thwarted to a halt. In the hopes of salvaging the situation and this momentum, I set up a call with our CTO who had informed us the project was being discarded. After some back and forth, we established that changes in the company direction are to be expected, but communicating the "why" would be necessary for the team to understand why the project they had been designing sometimes weeks had been discarded. It could also offer the opportunity to salvage some of the work already done, and adapt it to the change in priorities.                                                                                                                              | 
| what you'd do differently           | A few things: 1. I would've liked to have shed the intern mindset earlier so that I could've had more of an impact earlier on. 2. I would've liked to have worked on the Unity components of the project so that I could explore a new technology and have a truly full stack understanding of the product. This would've likely helped me understand the limitations and possibilities for innovation. 3. I would've pushed for testing and called out bad patterns earlier on. The technical debt that was accumulated caused a lot of friction, and required dedicated project time in the roadmap to be properly addressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 
| What are your weaknesses            | I've found that I often spend too long trying to solve a problem myself when asking for help can save so much time. A lot of what I've learned and what has made me a fairly good developer has come from trying out different solutions,  finding they don't work, and then trying another. But sometimes people with experience can provide that same learning in  a fraction of the time, and is something I discussed with my manager and worked on during my time at GS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 
| How would your friends describe you | People often are grateful that I will help them before addressing my own difficulties.  In my personal life, this might show as making sure their taxi is booked to get home from a night out before I book my  own. In my career, this manifests as pairing and unblocking my colleagues before carrying on with my own work. I'm mostly motivated by my own hatred of that feeling of being blocked and stuck, and the knowledge that often a second  pair of eyes or a new perspective can solve a problem in half the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 

### Product Questions

> How would you choose a feature to work on

* Collaborating with UX and Customer Success teams is generally the most effective way to understand what are users
  current pain points.
* Sitting in on user research sessions is huge, as well as on-sites, as often you can spot pain points that users have
  either
  accepted as unchanging or found awkward work arounds
* Mapping out the problems in a value/effort matrix to determine the biggest impact problems to tackle

### Team questions
1. What is the ratio of testers to developers? What is the interaction like between the two?
2. How does project planning currently go?
3. What has been the most challenging part of working here for you

### Technology Questions
1. I noticed you use technology X, how do you deal with problem Y?
2. Why did you the product chose X technology?
3. I'm hoping to learn more about X, is there opportunity to learn more at company
