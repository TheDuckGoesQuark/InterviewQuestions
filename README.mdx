# Interview Questions

## Setting up

Intellij is a bit weird about the structure of this project. Likely it'll complain about JUnit imports not existing.
To fix this, mark the `test` directory as the `Test Root`. Then hit `alt+enter` or `option+enter` and then `add junit.jar to classpath`
Should behave after that if you right click the test directory in the project file viewer and hit `run all tests`.
