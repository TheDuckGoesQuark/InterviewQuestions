 * There is an N by M matrix of zeroes.

 * Given N and M, write a function to count the number of
 * ways of starting at the top-left corner and getting to the bottom-right corner.
 * <p>
 * You can only move right or down.
 * <p>
 * For example, given a 2 by 2 matrix,
 * you should return 2,
 * since there are two ways to get to the bottom-right:
 * <p>
 * Right, then down
 * Down, then right
 * <p>
 * Given a 5 by 5 matrix,
 * there are 70 ways to get to the bottom-right.
