/**
 * We can determine how "out of order" an array A is by counting the number of inversions it has.
 * <p>
 * Two elements A[i] and A[j] form an inversion if A[i] > A[j] but i < j.
 * That is, a smaller element appears after a larger element.
 * <p>
 * Given an array, count the number of inversions it has. Do this faster than O(N^2) time.
 * <p>
 * You may assume each element in the array is distinct.
 * <p>
 * For example, a sorted list has zero inversions.
 * The array [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] has three inversions: (2, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 3).
 * The array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] has ten inversions: every distinct pair forms an inversion.
