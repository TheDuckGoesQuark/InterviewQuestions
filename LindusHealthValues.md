# Values

## Be transparent

> We share information across the whole team, avoiding hierarchies and silos

* This is second nature. As much as being the only person that knows how to do certain things might be great for job
  security,
* I 1. love to talk about what I'm working on, what I'm learning about, and getting opinions on my approaches
* and 2. I want my team to understand and feel in control around as much of the system as possible, and not ever be
  blocked by the person in the know being unavailable.
* Momentum is crucial, in the short term of a working day when you're in the flow, and the long term of a teams morale
  within a project.

## Stay Curious

> Keep asking questions, weâ€™ll never get anywhere by blindly following the status quo

* I'm always looking to challenge myself technically, and I truly love experimenting with new and old ways of doing
  things
* But I especially love throwing myself at domains I know very little in and surrounding myself with it.
* I absolutely plan on learning as much as possible from the team at Lindus, as it's the only way I have any right
  trying to understand and solve the problems being tackled properly.

## Be high-agency

> Nothing happens unless we make it happen, and we all take ownership and responsibility

* High-agency, autonomy, independence, these are second nature habits. In a startup environment, these qualities are
  dependent on trust in your team, even outside of engineering.
* That trust is earned through proving that when you're uncertain, you seek help, and when asked, you offer it without
  hesitation.
* And that when things go wrong, you don't point fingers or pass the buck, but get to work fixing the problem and making
  sure it doesn't happen again.

## Go fast

> Speed is life and our biggest competitive advantage, get used to faster OODA loops

* OODA: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act
* Part of OODA is identifying mistakes or bad directions early on.
* I interpret this as plan fast, don't overthink the feedback and try to fill in the blanks.
  But as we move to implement and research solutions, always be assessing the direction we're moving in
  to make sure we're still solving the right problem the most impactful way.

## Benefit patients

> Our most critical mission is to accelerate clinical trials so patients can benefit

* I've focused on skill development so far in my career,
  and while I absolute will continue to seek technical growth, I want to focus
  more on making genuine good change in the world. This is a product
  that I truly want to see succeed, and I'm prepared to give the effort that it would require.

## Have fun

> Most importantly, we are in the pursuit of fostering a fun environment for all.

* Building things people enjoy using, because of smooth or delighting UX, or because it
  genuinely makes their lives better, is fun at its core.

###  

> Plan Fast, Act Slow

* Trust intuition and ongoing feedback to decide what to focus on next.
  Then act slowly, break down the problem,
  always evaluating if we're going in the right direction.
